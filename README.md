main.js has the client logic (e.g. display logic)

server.js has the server logic (e.g. game logic)

style.css and index.html are for styling and structure of the page

You don't generally need to touch anything else.

To test locally, install Node.js (with npm), then run `node server.js` from inside the project's top folder
